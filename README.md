# ðŸ§¾ Online Coupon Sales Analysis

This project was completed during my internship at **NovaNectar Services Pvt. Ltd.**, focusing on the analysis and prediction of coupon usage patterns based on customer demographics and product engagement using Python and machine learning.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset `Coupons.csv` includes the following columns:

- `Gender` â€“ Customer gender
- `Age` â€“ Customer age
- `Item1`, `Item2`, `Item3` â€“ Items associated with each coupon
- `Coupon` â€“ Category or type of coupon

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the coupon sales dataset
- Analyze product-wise customer engagement
- Classify coupon usage based on product categories
- Perform feature engineering to improve model insights
- Build a baseline **Linear Regression model** to predict coupon usage patterns
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RÂ², MAE, MSE, and residual analysis

---

## ðŸ§ª Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling and evaluation)

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Analysis & Tasks

- âœ… Handled missing values and unwanted columns
- âœ… Merged `Item1`, `Item2`, and `Item3` into a unified product engagement view
- âœ… Visualized customer engagement by product category
- âœ… Created a heatmap of coupon vs product association
- âœ… Engineered new features like `Num_Items`
- âœ… Encoded categorical variables for modeling
- âœ… Trained a baseline Linear Regression model
- âœ… Visualized residuals and calculated error percentages

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Evaluation

- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Target**: Encoded `Coupon` category
- **Metrics**:
  - RÂ² Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Residual Distribution
  - Error Percentage Plot
